const welcome_p = "Once upon a time there was a magical island that lived in a little girl's head. The island was occupied by the most happiest and magical creatures. The girl thought that the island was long gone. Until recently… In the hardest of times the island was found…by that same girl, but it wasn't a dream anymore. It was as real as these words in front of you. The artist didn't only find that island, but brought it out for the world to see. The first creatures discovered were 'Just Bananaz'. Originally inspired by a teeny-tiny toy banana. Little did she know that this tiny banana was going to have 7000+ friends to chill with in the future.";
